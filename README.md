# MiniMax-Algorithm #
This is a futher development on my TicTacToe game, where I've implemented the MiniMax algorithm.
It makes the computer generate every single combination and gives it a score which the algorithm will use to make a play.
It is a recursive algorithm because it is a function which calls it self and if you were to draw it, it would make a tree diagram.
### Things I've learned ###
* The implementation of recursive functions.
* Better understanding of algorithms.
